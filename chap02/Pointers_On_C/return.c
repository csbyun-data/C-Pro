I can tell you why you can return str, but not str1:
first of all, a string literal, like anyother literals, are stored somewhere in the memory, not the runtime stack!
secondly, when a funtion returns, runtime stack var are destroyed, only the copy of return var is passed to memory.
Ok, let's come to the difference between char str*, and char str1[10]:
the char* str, makes the pointer "str" point to string literal "the string", so that when you return str, it always
points to the literal in memory; in other words, the string literal in memory is always there! A second fact is, you
cannot modify string literal by doing something like: *(str + 3) = 'X'; No!!

the statement char str1[10] = " the strint" actually initialize str1[0] = 't', str1[1] = 'h', str1[2] = 'e',...etc.
meanwhile, str1 NEVER points to the string literal!!! Secondly, we CAN MODIFY the value by saying str[2] = 'X', it
acts like a variable! just like: *(str1 + 2) = 'X';
However, the address str1, or str1 + i, is R-VALUE!!!! meaning when can assign: str = str1 + 3, but we CANNOT assign
str1 = 'some pointer'!!!!!

Finally, when function returns, the str1[i] just is discarded with the runtime stack. So that's why you will see
nothing
